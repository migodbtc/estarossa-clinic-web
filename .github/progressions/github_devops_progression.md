# 🚀 GitHub DevOps Progression Roadmap

Welcome! This roadmap is designed to help you leverage GitHub as a solo developer to master DevOps engineering, from the basics to professional/industry-grade skills. Each stage builds on the previous, with practical steps you can apply directly to this repository.

---

## 🟢 1. Basics: Git & GitHub Fundamentals

- [x] **Create a GitHub account** and set up your profile
- [x] **Clone, commit, push, pull**: Practice basic git commands in this repo
- [ ] **Branching**: Create, switch, and merge branches
- [x] **README.md**: Write and update project documentation
- [x] **.gitignore**: Exclude files/folders from version control
- [ ] **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs and ideas
- [ ] **Commits**: Write clear, meaningful commit messages

## 🟡 2. Intermediate: Collaboration & Automation

- [ ] **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Open PRs, review, and merge (even solo, for practice)
- [ ] **Labels & Milestones**: Organize issues and PRs
- [ ] **Project Boards**: Use GitHub Projects for kanban/task tracking
- [ ] **Actions (CI/CD)**: Set up a simple GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., run tests on push)
- [ ] **Branch Protection**: Configure rules for main branch
- [ ] **Code Reviews**: Use PR reviews/checks for self-auditing

## 🟠 3. Advanced: DevOps Practices

- [ ] **Automated Testing**: Integrate test suites with GitHub Actions
- [ ] **Linting & Formatting**: Add code quality checks (e.g., ESLint, Black)
- [ ] **Release Workflows**: Automate versioning and releases
- [ ] **Environment Secrets**: Store and use secrets in Actions
- [ ] **Status Badges**: Add CI status badges to README
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Use Dependabot for updates

## 🔵 4. Master: Infrastructure & Deployment

- [ ] **Multi-Stage Workflows**: Build, test, and deploy pipelines
- [ ] **Deploy to Cloud**: Automate deploys to platforms (e.g., Vercel, Azure, AWS)
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Store infra configs (e.g., Dockerfile, Terraform) in repo
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerts**: Integrate with tools for monitoring deployments
- [ ] **Rollback Strategies**: Implement safe deployment/rollback workflows

## 🟣 5. Professional/Industry Grade: Security, Compliance, & Scale

- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Use GitHub Advanced Security/code scanning
- [ ] **Audit Logs**: Review and understand repo audit logs
- [ ] **Compliance Workflows**: Automate license and compliance checks
- [ ] **Self-Hosted Runners**: Set up custom runners for CI/CD
- [ ] **Scaling Workflows**: Optimize workflows for large teams/repos
- [ ] **Open Source Best Practices**: Adopt community standards (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODEOWNERS)
